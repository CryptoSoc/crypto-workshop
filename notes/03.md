# Linum Labs Crypto Workshop: Week 3
01 September 2018

## Disclaimer
These are my personal notes from attending the sessions. They are nowhere near perfect and aren't trying to be. I make no promises about the accuracy or quality of my notes, but feel free to use them as you see fit. 

**If you would like to fix or add to these notes, please see the [Contributing](../README.md#contributing) section in the main README.**

## Thanks
Thank you to the CryptoSoc committee for organising this awesome opportunity for us. The least I can do is plug their [Github page](https://github.com/CryptoSoc) and shill their [super-dope coin](https://github.com/CryptoSoc/CryptoSocCoin). Thanks also to the good folks at [Linum Labs](https://linumlabs.com/) for the sessions.

## Token Standards
* **ERC20**: Fungible, widely used
* **ERC721**: Collectibles, non-fungible, e.g. CryptoKitties
* **ERC621**: Based on ERC-20 + increaseAndDecreaseSupply
* **ERC1155**: Latest, any number of non-fungible and fungible tokens, each is a subset, fewer steps in Atomic Swap, big gaming applications (skins and items can be traded). NB for trading between various fungible and non-fungible tokens with very low transaction (gas) costs.
* **ERC223**: Only a proposal, solves ERC20 transactions that don't match token type, huge amounts of tokens lost due to contracts inability to recognise the transaction. _"Oh shit, we don't accept this token. Let's cancel the transaction."_

---
* [Atomic Swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_swap): Trading one-for-one between non-like tokens without third party (takes multiple transactions prior to ERC1155).
* [Bancor protocol](https://support.bancor.network/hc/en-us/articles/360001165492-What-is-the-Bancor-Protocol-): "The Bancor Protocol is an open-source standard for Smart Tokens™ which interconnect to form a decentralized liquidity network, allowing every connected token to be automatically convertible for every other." (Atomic swaps between different currencies)
* Most token standards are proposed on the [Ethereum EIP issues page](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues).


## Curation Markets and Bonding Curves

* The [Curation Market whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VNkBjjGhcZUV9CyC0ccWYbqeOoVKT2maqX0rK3yXB20/edit) - "put your money where your mouth is"
* Tokens can be minted from contract at any time.
* Price increases over time.
* The stake to mint tokens is kept in a communal deposit.
* Tokens can be burnt back for stake at the current conversion.
* Can be used to curate lists and information, but with stake and backing behind it.
* Conversion is done on a bonded curve.
* "As more people stake in (and get tokens), the value of the tokens increases over time."
* The stake-in cost gets greater as the value of the tokens increases.
* Use cases: curating lists, datasets.
* Different to token-curated registries (where you have to have the token beforehand) as you buy the tokens to get involved. 
* Incentivises the creation and curation of lists and datasets (because the value goes up).
* You "get the money after doing the work", which is different to most funding schemes (e.g. government tenders, Kickstarters, investment rounds)
* You can make this really complex by adding off-chain oracles and making the bonding curves dynamic (which can be explicitly coded in).

## Token Curated Registries (TCRs)

Article: [City Walls & Bo-Taoshi: Exploring the Power of Token-Curated Registries](https://medium.com/@simondlr/city-walls-bo-taoshi-exploring-the-power-of-token-curated-registries-588f208c17d5)

* Curated (binary) list.
* "You're either in or you're out."
* Token holders can submit to list with a stake.
* Submissions can be *challenged* or *approved* by other token holders.
* Incentive to keep list curated via consensus reached by token holders, and price of token rising for well maintained list.
* Issues with sizing and permanence (marginal return).
* Use case example: **AToken** - curated list of sites for advertising
	* You want to add site.com, so you submit it for 100 tokens
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qpUi_DukwN45szCo5aYpCg.png)
	* If the majority **approves** your submission:
		* You keep your 100 tokens
		* The challengers lose tokens, which are divided equally amongst approvers
		* Site.com is added to the registry
	* If the majority **challenges** your submissions:
		* You lose your 100 tokens
		* The approvers lose tokens, which are divided equally amongst challengers
		* Site.com is not added to the registry

* Another use case:
	* "Reputation registry" for scientists (like ResearchGate, but community curated)
	*  Researchers submit their content to the registry.
	*  Instead of token holders approving, other researchers in registry approve.
	*  You can layer it: TCR of researchers is well curated. The researchers on the TCR approve patents and papers for the second TCR of content. The "gatekeepers" for the second list are curated in the first list.

## General Notes
* Today's Session: Token Standards and Curation Markets with Kent Fourie
* Vice video: [I Made My Shed The #1 Restaurant In London](https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/oobah-butler-i-made-my-shed-the-1-restaurant-in-london/5a5dfac6177dd44de3197af2%20) - on gaming third parties (as a contrast to TCRs)
* Blockchain mitosis: proposed idea for when a chain becomes long and burdensome (and the tail-end is old and outdated) it splits in half (like a cell).
* MyEtherWallet has a function call feature. If it exists and you can pay the gas, the function can be executed.
* [Steemit](https://steemit.com/) a blockchain-based blogging/reviews platform (kinda like Medium).
