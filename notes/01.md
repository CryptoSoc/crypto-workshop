# Linum Labs Crypto Workshop: Week 1
18 August 2018

## Disclaimer
These are my personal notes from attending the sessions. They are nowhere near perfect transcriptions of the slides and aren't trying to be. The actual slides are protected IP, but these notes are derivate content that is free to share and modify. I haven't captured everything discussed and, because we jump around a lot, have sections missing. I'm also interested in specific aspects of Crypto more than others and my notes reflect that. I'll try my best to take notes at all sessions that have a theoretical component, but I can't make any promises. I also make no promises about the accuracy or quality of my notes, but feel free to use them as you see fit. 

**If you would like to fix or add to these notes, please see the [Contributing](../README.md#contributing) section in the main README.**

## Thanks
Thank you to the CryptoSoc committee for organising this awesome opportunity for us. The least I can do is plug their [Github page](https://github.com/CryptoSoc) and shill their [super-dope coin](https://github.com/CryptoSoc/CryptoSocCoin). 

## Section 1: Core concepts

- _Digital Signatures_
	- Authorise transactions just like analogue ones do, but with two special properties
	- Only original signatory can make it, but anyone can verify it
	- It's tied to a particular document / file and is non-replicable
- _Key Pairs_
	- Public key
	- Private key
	- (And the signature proves you have the private key, without revealing it)
- _Cryptographic Hashes_
	- One-way function 
	- Produces a unique, fixed-length output
- _Merkle Tree_
	- Using hashes as input to new hashes
	![Merkle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Hash_Tree.svg/640px-Hash_Tree.svg.png)
- _Transactions_
	- If contradiction, second one rejected
	- Bitcoin every 10 mins
	- Ethereum every 10 secs
	- State Transition Function
		- Sender address + Destination address + ?
		- [Didn't really get this down]
- _Decentralisation and distributed consensus_
	- Uses *Proof of Work* (PoW)
		- Nonce 
		- Computing hashes with leading zeros
		- Mining
			- Creating new blocks gives a reward (e.g. a Bitcoin)
			- Verified by other nodes (easy because of how one-way nature of hash functions)
		- Has some problems
			- Constant ongoing expenditure
			- Energy inefficient
			- Economies of scale
			- Issues of collusion => neo-centralisation

## Section 2: Intro to Ethereum

- _Abstraction power of Turing-complete virtual machine_
	- Allows any computations to be performed
	- More general-purpose than Bitcoin
	- Don't need to create a new blockchain for every blockchain application. Just use the virtual machine to run different computations. This is the power of Ethereum as a platform.
	- Truly global singleton - a single, distributed computer.
	- "Wherever there's JavaScript, there's Ethereum"
	- "Ice Age": made a point where PoW became too expensive so that Proof of Stake can be ushered in.
- _Open source community_
	- Don't re-invent the wheel. 
	- Use the tools others built.
- _Contracts_
	- [Brushed over this, so probably best to read up online]
- _Transaction types_
	- Two state types
		- Externally owned account (EOA)
		- Contract ?
	- Components of a transaction
		- Sender and destination address
		- Value (amount of Ether to send)
		- Gas price (per op) - how much you're paying per op to incentivise miners to process
		- Gas limit (per transaction) -  how much is reserved for this tx to be completed
		- A data field that can contain any info
	- Transactions can be sent to
		- EOA: resulting in transfer of Ether
		- Contract (?)
			- Don't send currency to a contract. It won't send it back.
- _Contract Transactions_
	- Every node on the net processes every transaction and stores the entire state
	- To get around Halting Problem, the network charges a fee (Gas) for every operation, so incentivises efficient code
	- Gas used to incentivise miners to fill blocks to the top with content
	- Gas prices are a dynamic market
- _Proof of Stake (PoS)_
	- Instead of "how much work" behind a chain, it's "how much stake" behind a chain
	- Advantages
		- Lower inflation and energy usage
		- Increased scalability
		- 51% attacks more expensive
		- Increased decentralisation (prevents neo-centralisation)
	- Ethereum will use Casper (based on Ghost protocol)

	
## Section 3: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

- A VM is an emulation of a given computer system, running on a host
- The VM is (mostly) unaffected by the host machine's software issues (providing a security buffer)
- EVM built atop cryptographic systems and distributed, so quite secure and resilient 
- Reading is really cheap (on Gas), whilst writing is very expensive.

## Section 4: Distributed Apps (DApps)

- _What are they?_
	- A set of smart contracts
	- Serves as a shared database (DB) backend
	- Code built into the smart contracts operates on the data stored in the smart contracts
- _Case Study: CryptoKitties_
	- A game that spawned a standard — ERC721 — that came to be how we represent assets
	- Kinda broke the infrastructure, highlighting some key issues that are now being addressed.
- _Web3_
	- No hosting costs
	- Limited downtime and DoS vulnerability
	- No possibility of sale of data without consent
	- Works on Web3 packages
		- MetaMask
		- Eth.js
- _Building a DApp_
	- Frontend (e.g. HTML + JS)
	- Backend (manages the distributed DB)
	- Dev environments
		- MS Azure
		- Meter, Truffle
		- BlockApps
	- File storage
		- Sharded and distributed
		- Look up the address of the file
		- Use address to fine where the file is on the network
- _Case Study: The DAO and hard forks_
	- [Didn't really take notes on this, but it was a pretty cool story and spawned some good conversations. A thorough-looking article on it [here](https://medium.com/swlh/the-story-of-the-dao-its-history-and-consequences-71e6a8a551ee)]
- _Token Curated Registries (TCRs)_
	- "...decentrally-curated lists with intrinsic economic incentives for token holders to curate the list's contents judiciously"
	- Layers of incentivisation for all parties involved
	- Tiering systems (lists from lists)
	- <https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7>

### Fun thing I figured out during the session

Bitcoin uses the SHA256 hashing algorithm. You can generate hashes via the terminal using the [shasum](https://ss64.com/osx/shasum.html) tool (macOS):

```bash
$ <thing you want to hash> | shasum -a 256
```

... or use a web tool, like [this one](https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/)
