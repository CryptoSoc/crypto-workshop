# Linum Labs Crypto Workshop: Week 2
25 August 2018

## Disclaimer
These are my personal notes from attending the sessions. They are nowhere near perfect and aren't trying to be. I make no promises about the accuracy or quality of my notes, but feel free to use them as you see fit. 

**If you would like to fix or add to these notes, please see the [Contributing](../README.md#contributing) section in the main README.**

## Thanks
Thank you to the CryptoSoc committee for organising this awesome opportunity for us. The least I can do is plug their [Github page](https://github.com/CryptoSoc) and shill their [super-dope coin](https://github.com/CryptoSoc/CryptoSocCoin). Thanks also to the good folks at [Linum Labs](https://linumlabs.com/) for the sessions.

## General Notes
* [Remix](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/#optimize=false&version=soljson-v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js) is a solidity IDE.


## Tutorial 1 - [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) Lesson 1

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract ZombieFactory {

    // declare our event here

    uint dnaDigits = 16;
    uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    function _createZombie(string _name, uint _dna) private {
        zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna));
        // and fire it here
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(_str));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string _name) public {
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }

}

    and use it to create our web3 object.

      Artifacts are information about our contract such as its

      The ABI is a JavaScript object defining how to interact 
      with the contract including its variables, functions and 
      their parameters.
      Once we have the artifacts in our callback, we pass them 
      to TruffleContract(). This creates an instance of the 
      contract we can interact with.
      With our contract instantiated, we set its web3 provider 
      using the App.web3Provider value we stored earlier when 
      setting up web3.
      We then call the app's markAdopted() function in 
      case any pets are already adopted from a previous

     We first declare the variable adoptionInstance 
     outside of the smart contract calls so we can access 
     the instance after initially retrieving it. 
     Using call() allows us to read data from the 
     blockchain without having to send a full transaction, 
     meaning we won't have to spend any ether. 
     After calling getAdopters(), we then loop through 
     all of them, checking to see if an address is stored 
     for each pet. Since the array contains address types, 
     Ethereum initializes the array with 16 empty addresses. 
     This is why we check for an empty address string rather 
     than null or other falsey value. Once a petId with a 
     corresponding address is found, we disable its adopt 
     button and change the button text to "Success", so the 
     user gets some feedback. Any errors are logged to the console.

     deployed contract as we did above and store the instance 
     in adoptionInstance. This time though, we're going to send 
     a transaction instead of a call. Transactions require a 
     "from" address and have an associated cost. This cost, 
     paid in ether, is called gas. The gas cost is the fee 
     for performing computation and/or storing data in a 
     smart contract. We send the transaction by executing the 
     adopt() function with both the pet's ID and an object 
     containing the account address, which we stored earlier 
     in account.
     The result of sending a transaction is the transaction object. If there are no errors, we proceed to call our markAdopted() function to sync the UI with our newly stored data.
