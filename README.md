# Linum Labs Crypto Workshop

## Disclaimer
These are my personal notes and files from attending the sessions. They are nowhere near perfect transcriptions of the slides and aren't trying to be. The actual slides are protected IP, but these notes are derivate content that is free to share and modify. I haven't captured everything discussed and, because we jump around a lot, have sections missing. I'm also interested in specific aspects of Crypto more than others and my notes reflect that. I'll try my best to take notes at all sessions that have a theoretical component, but I can't make any promises. I also make no promises about the accuracy or quality of my notes, but feel free to use them as you see fit. 

**If you would like to fix or add to these documents, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section at the end.**

## Thanks
Thank you to the CryptoSoc committee for organising this awesome opportunity for us. The least I can do is plug their [Github page](https://github.com/CryptoSoc) and shill their [super-dope coin](https://github.com/CryptoSoc/CryptoSocCoin).
